# MGCSBM
Temporal Action Localization with Multi-granularity Feature Aggregation and Cross-level Boundary Modeling

Our code is built upon the codebase from [ActionFormer](https://github.com/happyharrycn/actionformer_release),[TemporalMaxer](https://github.com/TuanTNG/TemporalMaxer) and [Tridet](https://github.com/dingfengshi/TriDet), and we would like to express our gratitude for their outstanding work.

## Environment
- Ubuntu20.04
-  NVIDIA RTX A6000 GPU
-  Python3.8, Pytorch2.0 and CUDA11.8
-  `h5py,
joblib,
matplotlib,
numpy,
pandas,
PyYAML,
scikit_learn,
scipy,
setuptools`


## Install NMS
```
cd ./libs/utils
python setup.py install --user
cd ../..
```

## Data preparation
We use the same features as [Tridet](https://github.com/dingfengshi/TriDet). To use these features, please download them from their link and unpack them into the `./data` folder.


## Pretrained Models
We provide our pre-trained models.
